  "noun": "A noun is a **person, place, or thing**. Anything that can be considered \"something\" is a noun.\n\nSome examples of nouns are: `cat`, `pencil`, `Ben`, `love`, `SARS-CoV-2`. A noun does not necessarily have to be a physical object; for example *hope* and *love* are nouns.\n\nA __plural__ noun is more than one of a noun. Usually, an \"s\" is put at the end of a noun to make it plural. Some \nexamples of plural nouns are: `cats`, `pencils`, `viruses`. In some cases, the plural form of a noun is the same as the regular form. For example plural form of \"deer\" is also \"deer\". You don't say \"deers\".\n\nA __proper__ noun is a specific name of a more generic noun. For example, \"person\" is a regular noun, but \"Sam\" is a proper noun. Sam is the name of a person. Proper nouns are always capitalized.",
  "adjective": "An adjective is a **word that describes a noun**. `big`, `blue`, `thick` are examples of adjectives. They can all be put before a noun, like \"big cat\" or \"thick pencil\".",
  "verb": "A verb is an **action word**. When you do something, you can describe that with a verb. `run`, `play`, `yeet` are all verbs. You can pair these with a noun to have the noun \"do\" the verb, like \"The cat likes to play\".\n\nA verb __ending in ED__  (or past tense) is a verb being done in the past. Usually, they are regular verbs ending in ED,  but not always. For example, you don't say \"runned\", you say \"ran\". You may put \"ran\" when a game calls for \"ending in ED\", since they are both past tense and therefore can both be used in the same context.",
  "adverb": "An adverb is a **word that describes a verb**, or shows how the verb is being done. Most adverbs end in \"ly\". `quickly`, `lazily`, `excitedly` are all adverbs. They can be paired with verbs; for example \"The cat plays lazily\"."
