# Privacy Policy 

## Data Collection
MadBot only has the ability to view user data through user interactions, which includes slash commands exclusively, buttons, and form submissions. 

MadBot does not store any data other than that made available to users through any of the commands:
- Custom templates
- Game history (includes usernames of participants)

A feature is being worked on that will allow server admins to clear game history and users to opt out of sharing their usernames. 

## Data Use
MadBot's data is contained within a secure database on the local machine, which is only available to the owner of the bot. The data is not shared with any third parties, and will not need to be anytime in the future.
