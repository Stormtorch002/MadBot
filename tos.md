# MadBot Terms of Service

By inviting MadBot, using any command of MadBot, or participating in any MadBot activity, you agree to the following terms.

## Acceptable Use

Do not use MadBot in any way that:
- Violates Discord TOS
- Infringes on any written copyrighted material
- Reveals passwords, real addresses, IP addresses, etc.
- Could be used to dox or threaten personal privacy/security of any user
- Contains or promotes discriminatory language toward any race, gender, or religion
- Deliberately prevents the bot from functioning or performing normally
- Using any external macro or script to automate the process of playing a game

These terms apply to the following commands:
- */madlibs*
- */custom add*, */custom edit*, */custom import*
- */feedback*

If you are a server admin, please delete any custom template using the */custom delete* command that violates the acceptable use conditions.

Because MadBot is still relatively small-scale, please send a message request to *stormtorch* (Storch) on Discord to report any additional instances of unacceptable use.
